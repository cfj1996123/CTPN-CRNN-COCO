# CTPN-CRNN-COCO
An horizontal text recognition framework with COCO-text Dataset

This repository is built based on [eragonruan](https://github.com/eragonruan/text-detection-ctpn)'s implementation on CTPN and [BelBES](https://github.com/BelBES/crnn-pytorch)'s implementation on CRNN.

The papers we refer to are:[Detecting Text in Natural Image with Connectionist Text Proposal Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.03605.pdf)
and
[An End-to-End Trainable Neural Network for Image-based Sequence Recognition and Its Application to Scene Text Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.05717)

For instructions on running CTPN and CRNN, see markdown files inside ./ctpn and ./crnn folders.
